# Fruit Classifier Web App Repository

This repo is the code base for the web app version of a deep learning model I created using the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) library. Upload an image of any of the listed fruits on the page and let it tell you what fruit you uploaded. Try it out and let me know how it goes!

The web app can be accessed [here](https://eli-fruit-classifier.onrender.com).

The jupyter notebook used to create and train this model will be uploaded shortly.

Check out the [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) course by fast.ai that taught me how to create this!

This repo was forked from the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) starter repo for deploying their models on [Render](https://render.com). The original repo from fast.ai can be found [here](https://github.com/render-examples/fastai-v3).
